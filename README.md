# Manga Read-Along Video Creator

## Overview

This repository contains a set of Python scripts designed to transform raw manga images and associated JSON data into engaging read-along videos. Inspired by children's voice books, the videos feature character speech bubbles that appear in sync with narration, providing an interactive experience for weebs. (yes I use ChatGPT to generate this)

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Use Magiv2 to get the transcript
- **Bubble Chat Animation**: Creates a dynamic speech bubble sequence corresponding to character dialogues.
- **Video Creation**: Converts the processed images into a video format using `img2mp4.py`, enabling smooth playback of the read-along experience.
- **Voice over**: Uses a TTS model to read out the dialogue extracted from the images. The TTS engine converts the text into natural-sounding speech, which is then synchronized with the bubble animations.

## Files Included

- `main.py`: The main file to run the whole process
- `utils/process_raw_from_json.py`: Script for processing manga images and generating animated bubble chats based on JSON data.
- `utils/img2mp4.py`: Script for converting a series of images into a video file.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies needed to run the scripts.

## Usage

1. **Setup Environment**: 
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2.  **Prepare Your Data**:
    
    *   Place your manga images in a designated folder.
    *   Works best when the raw is in English and they are named in sequential order (e.g., `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, `03.jpg`)
    *   Ensure the corresponding JSON files (generated by MagiV2) are accessible.

3.  **Process Images and create Video with voice**:
    
    *   Run the `main.py` script, providing the necessary paths for images and JSON files.
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    
4.  **View the Demo**:
    
    *   A video demo showcasing the read-along feature can be found in the repository.
